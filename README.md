I had a very difficult time getting anything to work.
First I tried to change the id and classes in an attempt to get my values to save in local storage, but had no luck.

The current date appeared in my jumbotron, but when I added the color-coded time span it seemed to break it and I still don't know why.

I'm going to turn it in, but will work on improving it after more review and training.
